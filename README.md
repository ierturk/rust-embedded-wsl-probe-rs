# Blinky example in Rust on the STM32F429-Discovery board with probe-rs on VSCode

Small project example to be used as template for embedded software in Rust on the STM32F429-Nucleo board.

If everything is installed properly, the workspace can be opened in VS Code and a hit on F5 should build the project without errors or warnings and automatically start a debug session. The program should be halted at the breakpoint at main().
